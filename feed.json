One of the classics of New Journalism or Creative Nonfiction or whatever the kids are calling it these days. With bonus cameo appearance by Harlan Ellison.\n",

Back in the dotcom boom, after I pointed out to upper management (with impolite candor that I&rsquo;d be mortified by today) that a couple of consultants we&rsquo;d hired were not much better than con artists, I was forced to attend “executive training” sessions with a corporate psychologist who, if I&rsquo;d written them into a story, would have been editorially questioned as a poor caricature of afternoon TV host ambition. During those grinding weeks, I took the MBTI and a couple other scantronnesque tests, and while on the surface their results appealed to my sense of self and identity, I soon got the same feeling I&rsquo;d had as a kid when I&rsquo;d figured out the scam behind the funny page’s daily horoscope column.</p>\n<p>Another employer wasted months on DISC assessments for everyone in management roles, and then wasted more time getting everyone to understand RA(S)CI grids, both of which dropped from use within weeks.
